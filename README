GRAYHATS EXAMPLES
=================

This repository is made up of all the content that you may see in a meeting.

That is, if we remember to put it up here. :-)

Included are:

1. Networking

   This lecture was about basic networking topics, like the OSI Model, TCP, and
   UDP. It also made heavy usage of Wireshark to visually see the packets being
   sent over the network.

2. Metasploit

   This lecture was about basic penetration testing with Metasploit. We made
   use of vulnerable Windows 7 boxes and hacked them with EternalBlue.

3. Network Recon

   This lecture was about how to find nodes on the network you are on with
   nmap. We got a diverse group of boxes and used nmap to figure out what was
   running on them without logging into them.
